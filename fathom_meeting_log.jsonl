They've been in business for 21 years, specializing in account service for chemical and life sciences companies.

They trust McClellan's judgment and wanted to explore potential fit with White Label IQ.\n\nWhat services are you looking for?\n\nHMA is primarily seeking help with video production, PPC management, analytics, and Google Tag Manager. They also expressed interest in email marketing support and marketing automation system integration.\n\nTheir Questions\n\nDo you work with different marketing automation systems?\n\nBrian explained that while they're not specialists, they can work on integrating and optimizing data inside reporting tools, and can set up API connections if needed.\n\nCan you build emails in different marketing automation systems?\n\nBrian confirmed they can build emails and set up campaigns in various systems, but don't typically provide strategy or push the send button.\n\nHow do you handle pricing for small PPC campaigns?\n\nBrian acknowledged that their standard pricing model might not fit HMA's needs for small, niche campaigns. He suggested a follow-up call with Abby Carey to discuss customized solutions.\n\nHow would we push work to you?\n\nBrian explained that they can be flexible, working within the client's project management system, accepting work via email, or providing access to their own project management platform.\n", "title": "Drew Dorgan"}}

These projects are complex in terms of billing, client relationships, and potential growth opportunities.\n\nWhat is the expected communication cadence?\n\nRegular scheduled calls including morning stand-ups with the entire team. Akhil is expected to join Monday, Wednesday, Friday check-ins. The team encourages direct communication and asking questions whenever needed.\n\nTheir Questions\n\nWhich projects should Akhil focus on initially?\n\nBrian and Ashton advised Akhil to get involved with as many ongoing client projects as possible, starting with shadowing and gradually taking on more responsibilities.\n\nHow can Akhil access Asana projects?\n\nBrian acknowledged that Asana implementation is still in progress and that he would provide access soon. In the meantime, Orbit should be considered the primary source of truth for project information.\n\nWhat level of initiative should Akhil take in addressing tasks?\n\nThe team encourages Akhil to take ownership of tasks he can handle quickly, especially if it prevents unnecessary escalation to White Label IQ.

They're not monetized and there's limited tracking of usage. Higher-ups see value in having apps, but some team members question their necessity.\n\nIs there any promotion around these apps?\n\nVery limited. The apps don't seem to be prominently featured on the website or in marketing materials.\n\nAre there any new initiatives or big pushes outside of the websites?\n\nNot specifically mentioned. The company appears to be in a phase of consolidating and building a foundation rather than launching new major initiatives.\n\nHow do reps fit into the organization's structure?\n\nBurke is very sales-driven, with a strong focus on relationships with reps.

How's business for you?\n\nThe association is \"purring along\" but facing challenges due to changing political administrations and agency regulations. Business has been impacted by decreased disposable income and perceptions of Colorado as expensive.\n\nDo you think your firm's positioned to do that pretty well right now?\n\nDavid expressed uncertainty about CROA's positioning for AI and technological changes, indicating a need for education and adaptation.\n\nWhat's going on in your, like, you said it was a good level, a good year, but like, how's the association going? How's business for you?\n\nWhile it was a decent year for rafting, there are concerns about decreased visitation and economic challenges affecting the industry.\n\nYou ever going to come speak to us at CROA again at our convention?\n\nDavid expressed interest in potentially having Brian speak at a future convention, particularly if there's more focus on AI education.\n\nIs there any kind of a fund where people contribute to basically promote the association or promote whitewater rafting within the state that's not company-specific?\n\nNo, the association deliberately avoids collective marketing to prevent favoritism concerns among members.\n\nDo a lot of your organization do a lot of focus on B2B as an area to kind of drum up instead of like direct to consumer?\n\nGroup business (B2B) is significant in the rafting world, including churches, banks, and law firms, but it's not as big as it was 20 years ago due to economic shifts.\n\nTheir Questions\n\nWhat are you offering now, Brian, I should tell my members about?\n\nBrian explained White Label IQ's services, including design, development, site maintenance, chatbots, email campaigns, and web-related services, but noted they don't provide industry-specific marketing strategy.\n\nIf somebody came to you and said, I want to do a campaign on Facebook, you'd send them elsewhere?\n\nBrian clarified that while they can handle technical aspects and execution of campaigns, they would bring in partners for industry-specific strategy if needed.\n", "title": "David Costlow"}}

What's your methodology?\n\nSanchita keeps it brand-centered, sitting with brand advocates to understand their passion, vision, and focus. She then curates stories that align with the brand's unique perspective.\n\nHow do you use AI?\n\nSanchita uses AI as a personal assistant for brainstorming, understanding complex topics, and researching trends. She uses tools like Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Gemini for research, then creates original content.\n\nHow would you write case studies?\n\nSanchita creates a structure and content pillars to avoid repetition. She develops different angles for various audiences and builds a structure including introduction, key highlights, user testing, and customer reactions.\n\nCan you tell me about technical writing versus creative writing? What's your style?\n\nFor creative writing, Sanchita sees a free canvas to play with medium and style. For technical writing, she focuses on making content as communicable as possible, explaining complex concepts in an easily understandable manner.\n\nHow do you interface with clients and get information for writing?\n\nSanchita uses quarterly and monthly charts to plan content initiatives. She creates content in advance, shares it with clients for approval, and incorporates their feedback.\n\nHow do you manage teams?\n\nSanchita emphasizes Monday meetings to set weekly goals, conducts mid-week check-ins, and maintains an open-door policy for feedback and addressing challenges.\n\nTheir Questions\n\nWhat do you think would be your first tap into or biggest growth opportunity?\n\nBrian explained that the immediate focus is on launching new AI product offerings and increasing AI deployment within the company. Long-term plans include expanding into direct-to-client work under a different brand and potentially expanding into other countries with local sales and account teams.\n\nDo you want White Label to be seen as an executional partner who is invisible during the process or somebody who's a very visible thought leader in the industry?\n\nBrian stated that White Label IQ aims to be a visible thought leader and solutions provider, while remaining flexible to meet agency clients' preferences for visibility or invisibility.\n\nWhat are the KPIs that matter to you the most for somebody coming into this role?\n\nBrian highlighted three primary KPIs: engagement (downloads, website visits, time spent), growth of qualified audience, and conversion (collaboration with sales team).\n\nWhat is the current proportion of leads and conversions from inbound to outbound or to referrals?\n\nBrian estimated that about 60% of clients come through referrals or sponsorships, while 40% come from social media awareness, email outreach, or search.\n\nTo what extent would I be expected to support client-facing materials?\n\nSanchita would be responsible for creating onboarding kits, documentation for new products and processes, and contributing to RFPs and proposals when needed.\n\nWhat does the current demand pipeline look like, and are there certain leaks affecting the numbers or marketing efforts?\n\nBrian identified leaks in nurturing existing clients and prospects, limited understanding of opportunities in sales qualified prospects, and challenges in cross-selling due to clients' limited awareness of White Label IQ's full capabilities.\n\nHow open would it be to create more testimonial videos, tutorial videos, or educational videos?\n\nBrian expressed openness to creating various forms of content, including videos, for both internal education and client-facing materials. He noted the challenge of creating testimonials due to confidentiality agreements.\n", "title": "Sanchita Agarwal _ Content Lead _ WLIQ"}}

Multiple single-purpose standalone apps\n    Both options address Burke's need for a new app while providing flexibility in implementation.\n\nTech Stack\n\n  - Potential use of React Native for cross-platform development (iOS and Android)\n  - Consideration of AI-assisted development processes\n\nObjections\n\n  - Marketing team doesn't want the app and doesn't find it useful\n  - Concerns about development costs and complexity\n\nCompetitors\n\nNo specific competitors mentioned in the transcript.\n\nTimeline\n\n  - Two meetings with Burke marketing team (this week and next week)\n  - Final meeting with Burke leadership this month\n  - Goal to get sign-off and start development within the month\n\nNext Steps\n\n1.  Create a list of viable app ideas with descriptions and cost ranges\n2.  Prepare pros and cons for different app options\n3.  Compile and merge discovery documents\n4.  Internal review of proposals\n5.  Present options to Huebner Marketing for review\n6.  Prepare presentation for Burke leadership meeting\n\nQ&A\n\nOur Questions\n\nDo you agree that they're looking for a high-level description of what we could do and cost ranges?\n\nYes, the team agreed that Burke is looking for high-level descriptions and cost estimates for potential app solutions.\n\nAre you able to put together the options and descriptions?\n\nAlay confirmed he can create an Orbit task and compile the information, with Nitesh handling coordination and feasibility checks.\n\nTheir Questions\n\nShould we create or modify something within the current code base to make the new app work?\n\nBrian clarified that the old software won't be useful unless Burke wants to revive it. At most, they should review it to understand what Burke currently has and potentially port over user accounts.\n\nWhat instructions should we get and ask from the current company who developed this app?\n\nBrian suggested focusing on understanding the current app to make something better, rather than trying to modify the existing codebase.\n", "title": "Burke Fitness App"}}

Tanya to draft the referral policy content and send to Brian for review\n2.  Ishaan to add approved referral policy to the agency playbook and create a one-sheeter\n3.  Tanya to compile a list of SQLs and other potential cold outreach targets\n4.  Rhea to create cold email templates and sequences\n5.  Tanya to research and personalize cold outreach emails for specific targets\n6.  Update agency playbook with current information (e.g., 2025 holiday dates, team members)\n7.  Plan for informational emails about upcoming Indian holidays\n\nQ&A\n\nOur Questions\n\nWhat is White Label IQ's typical referral plan?\n\nWhite Label IQ pays 10% of AGI (Annual Gross Income) for the first year to referrers. They do not accept referral payments when they refer clients to others.\n\nWhere can we find potential cold outreach targets?\n\nBrian suggested using the SQL list in Pipedrive, filtering by last email sent/received. He also mentioned the agency core direct mail list and contacts from the Agency Builders conference in February.\n\nHow can we identify viable cold outreach targets?\n\nBrian suggested using ChatGPT Pro to analyze potential client websites and determine if they're a good fit for White Label IQ's services.\n\nTheir Questions\n\nShould we include past clients in the cold outreach?\n\nBrian initially suggested including past clients, but it was clarified that past clients would be covered in separate re-engagement and reactivation campaigns.\n\nHow should we communicate about not accepting referral payments?\n\nThere was a discussion about whether to explicitly state that White Label IQ doesn't accept referral payments.

They are also planning to update their agency playbook and send out informational emails to existing and past clients.\n\nPain\n\n  - Lack of a formalized referral policy for agencies\n  - Need to re-engage with SQL (Sales Qualified Leads) that haven't been contacted in a while\n  - Desire to start cold outreach to new potential agency clients\n\nImpact\n\n  - Potential missed opportunities for new business through referrals\n  - Stagnant sales pipeline due to lack of engagement with SQLs\n  - Limited growth without proactive outreach to new potential clients\n\nCritical Event\n\nThe company wants to implement these initiatives immediately to drive growth and re-engage with potential clients.\n\nDecision Process\n\n  - Brian Gerstner (White Label IQ) is the key decision-maker for the referral policy and outreach strategies\n  - The team (Tanya, Rhea, Deepak) will draft and implement the plans, with Brian's approval\n  - Account managers will need to be informed and trained on the new referral policy\n\nEconomic Buyer\n\nBrian Gerstner, as the representative from White Label IQ, appears to be the economic buyer and final decision-maker for these initiatives.\n\nSolution Fit\n\n  - Implementing a referral program aligns with White Label IQ's goal of growing their agency client base\n  - Cold outreach and re-engagement with SQLs fit their need to expand and revitalize their sales pipeline\n  - Updating the agency playbook and sending informational emails addresses the need to keep clients informed and engaged\n\nTech Stack\n\n  - Pipedrive (CRM system mentioned for managing leads and clients)\n  - ChatGPT Pro (suggested for analyzing potential client websites)\n  - Notion (used for internal documentation)\n\nObjections\n\n  - Concern about how to communicate the referral policy without seeming self-serving\n  - Hesitation about directly mentioning that White Label IQ doesn't accept referral payments\n\nCompetitors\n\nNo specific competitors mentioned in the transcript.\n\nTimeline\n\n  - Referral plan draft to be completed by midnight for Brian's review\n  - Cold outreach emails to start immediately\n  - Agency playbook updates to be completed before sharing with clients\n\nNext Steps\n\n1.  Tanya to draft the referral policy content and send to Brian for review\n2.  Ishaan to add approved referral policy to the agency playbook and create a one-sheeter\n3.  Tanya to compile a list of SQLs and other potential cold outreach targets\n4.  Rhea to create cold email templates and sequences\n5.  Tanya to research and personalize cold outreach emails for specific targets\n6.  Update agency playbook with current information (e.g., 2025 holiday dates, team members)\n7.  Plan for informational emails about upcoming Indian holidays\n\nQ&A\n\nOur Questions\n\nWhat is White Label IQ's typical referral plan?\n\nWhite Label IQ pays 10% of AGI (Annual Gross Income) for the first year to referrers. They do not accept referral payments when they refer clients to others.\n\nWhere can we find potential cold outreach targets?\n\nBrian suggested using the SQL list in Pipedrive, filtering by last email sent/received. He also mentioned the agency core direct mail list and contacts from the Agency Builders conference in February.\n\nHow can we identify viable cold outreach targets?\n\nBrian suggested using ChatGPT Pro to analyze potential client websites and determine if they're a good fit for White Label IQ's services.\n\nTheir Questions\n\nShould we include past clients in the cold outreach?\n\nBrian initially suggested including past clients, but it was clarified that past clients would be covered in separate re-engagement and reactivation campaigns.\n\nHow should we communicate about not accepting referral payments?\n\nThere was a discussion about whether to explicitly state that White Label IQ doesn't accept referral payments. It was decided to focus on educating clients about the referral program without emphasizing this aspect.\n", "title": "Impromptu Zoom Meeting"}}

Present the proposal to the client to generate excitement for Phase 2 development\n\nQ&A\n\nOur Questions\n\nHow fleshed out does the proposal need to be?\n\nHM wants to see a more comprehensive solution beyond just migration and update, including potential features and rough cost estimates for different options.\n\nWhat would be the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the redeveloped app?\n\nThe core fitness app functionality with the addition of a Playground Finder feature, and potentially push notifications capability.\n\nCan we price out features as a \"basket of goods\"?\n\nYes, WLIQ will provide a breakdown of costs for core functionality and additional features as add-ons.\n\nTheir Questions\n\nWhat's the timeline for getting this fleshed-out proposal?\n\nWLIQ will provide an exact timeline for developing the cost estimates and proposal by the next day.\n\nHow much work is involved in transferring the app from one account to another?\n\nThe actual transfer process takes about 4-5 hours, with minimal coding involved. However, this doesn't include the transfer of the codebase, which is a separate process.\n", "title": "HM / WLIQ Discussion - Burke Fitness App"}}

Currently seeing growth again, partly due to ADP's rebrand requiring additional support.\n\nWhat's a typical estimating time you expect?\n\nDave expressed frustration with the 4-hour turnaround time for estimates from Jessica, noting that by the time they receive estimates, they've often moved on to other solutions.\n\nWould a Slack channel help with communication?\n\nDave was receptive to using Slack for quick updates and confirmations, but agreed with Brian that actual project tasks should still go through the formal system.\n\nHow many websites do you need maintained?\n\nDave mentioned having approximately 15-17 websites requiring regular updates, which his team currently struggles to maintain properly.\n\nTheir Questions\n\nHow long does estimating typically take?\n\nBrian explained that while timing varies by project complexity, they've developed a pricing sheet to expedite common requests. He suggested establishing standard times for common tasks (e.g., \"Can I just say four hours every time?\") and adjusting as needed based on actual work required.\n\nHow does the ad hoc work process flow?\n\nBrian explained that they cap ad hoc work at 15 hours, after which they provide a fixed-cost estimate. He acknowledged the challenges of time zone differences and noted they're building U.S. Eastern time zone resources to improve responsiveness.\n\nWhat are the FTE options and pricing?\n\nBrian detailed two options: (1) Dedicated FTE at $4,000 for 140 hours of executable time with one dedicated person, and (2) Blended FTE at $6,000 for 210 hours with a team of up to four dedicated people. Both options work out to approximately $28/hour. He's developing quarter-time, half-time, and three-quarter time options.\n\nWhat does the website maintenance service include?\n\nBrian explained their fixed-price maintenance service ($199 per site, with volume discounts available) includes scheduled updates, security patches, QA, reporting, and notification processes. It's primarily focused on security and keeping plugins and WordPress up to date.\n", "title": "David Annunziato"}}

Primarily select service brands like Fairfield Inns, Kempton Hotels, and Courtyards, with some independent properties.\n\nWhat tracking capabilities do you have?\n\nMost clients (95-98%) are branded hotels with extremely limited tracking - only campaign data is available. No website data, commerce tracking, or ability to place tracking pixels. Some soft brands allow site function tracking but not commerce data. A small minority (restaurants and independent hotels) have full tracking.\n\nWhat KPIs are you reporting against?\n\nPrimary KPIs are share of voice, click-through rate, and CPC. Each has specific targets that must be hit.\n\nWhat campaign types are you running?\n\nPrimarily paid search (75% of clients), with some running GDN, very few doing TrueView (only 3), and only 2 doing demand gen.\n\nWhat are your budget ranges?\n\nSearch budgets range from $1,000 (minimum) to $7,000 (largest). Most clients maintain steady monthly budgets with some seasonal adjustments.\n\nHow are your Google Ads accounts organized?\n\nMost are under one master MCC, with approximately 8 clients requiring use of their own MCCs.\n\nDo you have a project management system?\n\nThey use ClickUp and would require White Label IQ to integrate with it.\n\nTheir Questions\n\nWould we be open to a trial run with just 11 clients?\n\nAbby confirmed White Label IQ would be open to a 3-4 month test with 11 clients from one management company at a reduced price point, with the understanding that if successful, the other clients would follow.\n\nIs there anything related to campaigns that we specifically don't do?\n\nAbby explained that White Label IQ can handle all Google Ads campaign types and tasks, though they might push back if one account required excessive time beyond what's profitable. She noted they don't do large e-commerce campaigns with thousands of products, but that's not relevant to Cogwheel's business.\n\nHow would budget management work?\n\nAbby explained they could use scripts to create hard stops when budgets are reached, preloading exact monthly amounts to ensure accurate spending.\n", "title": "Michael Curran"}}

She found she preferred communicating with clients over candidates and has been interested in client account management since.\n\nHow do you balance personalized, high-touch service with efficiency and scale when managing multiple agencies?\n\nZeel emphasizes prioritization and time management. She has experience managing up to 32 agencies, so 10-12 agencies is manageable for her.\n\nHow do you address being overwhelmed with work and not meeting deadlines?\n\nZeel believes in clear, proactive communication with clients. She would inform them beforehand about potential delays and provide new timelines.\n\nHow do you communicate technical requirements to non-technical clients?\n\nZeel, being non-technical herself, would first simplify the information for her own understanding by discussing with the project manager. She would then convey this simplified version to the client.\n\nHow do you clarify vague or incomplete requests from clients?\n\nZeel would ask as many questions as needed to get clarity before passing information to the team. She appreciates that White Label IQ has prepared questionnaires for different types of projects.\n\nHow do you handle client objections or pushback on pricing?\n\nZeel would emphasize the quality of services provided and justify the pricing. If needed, she would consider offering temporary discounts or work with management on pricing strategies.\n\nHow do you identify and position new service opportunities to existing clients?\n\nZeel would research the client's current website or services, identify areas for improvement, and pitch relevant services like redesign, upgrades, or new platforms.\n\nWhich KPI do you think will be most challenging, and how will you approach it?\n\nZeel ranked the KPIs from most to least challenging: 1) Upsell closure, 2) Quote conversion, 3) Timely responses, 4) Client retention. She acknowledged the potential challenge with timely responses due to time zones but noted her shift aligns with U.S. times.\n\nWhat's the toughest client situation you've managed, and how did you resolve it?\n\nZeel described a difficult Australian client who was reluctant to communicate and escalated issues. She resolved it by requesting a call to address pain points from both sides and implementing better communication tools.\n\nWhat do you find most rewarding and challenging about account management?\n\nMost challenging: Working without appreciation. Most rewarding: Client renewals, successful upsells, and quick quote conversions.\n\nAre you a self-starter or do you prefer clear structure and assigned tasks?\n\nZeel describes herself as a self-starter, which aligns well with the independent nature of the role at White Label IQ.\n\nWhere do you see yourself evolving in this role over the next 2-3 years?\n\nZeel aspires to reach a senior level where she can mentor others and guide them in client account management.\n\nWhat are you most excited about working here?\n\nZeel is most excited about working with a U.S.-based team, as she has experience with U.S. clients but not U.S. teammates.\n\nDo you have any concerns about working remotely with a U.S. team?\n\nZeel doesn't see major challenges, as she'll be working in the U.S. time zone. She acknowledges this is her first remote job, so she'll need to experience it to know for sure.\n\nTheir Questions\n\nWhat are your expectations from me as a team member?\n\nJessica emphasized being a self-starter, taking initiative to grow and manage client accounts independently, meeting KPIs, and maintaining open communication with the team when needed.\n", "title": "Zeel Gadhavi _ Client Account Manager _ White Label IQ"}}

Brian Gerstner is engaging Nishan as a freelancer to produce this content, with the potential for long-term employment.\n\nPain\n\n  - Lack of clear, concise marketing materials explaining FTE and Blended FTE options\n  - Need for content that demonstrates understanding of client needs and pain points\n  - Difficulty in quickly qualifying leads and moving them from awareness to desire\n\nImpact\n\n  - Potential loss of clients due to inability to effectively communicate program benefits\n  - Time wasted on unqualified leads who don't understand the offerings\n  - Missed opportunities to differentiate from competitors and showcase flexibility\n\nCritical Event\n\nBrian needs this content produced quickly to support ongoing sales efforts and improve lead qualification. He wants to use this project to evaluate Nishan's capabilities for potential long-term employment.\n\nDecision Process\n\n1.  Nishan will create initial content based on the brief\n2.  Multiple revision rounds (3-4) with Brian\n3.  Input from Ashant (marketing content manager) and Deepak (sales team)\n4.  Final approval from Brian\n5.  Creative handoff to design team\n\nEconomic Buyer\n\nBrian Gerstner, who has authority to approve the content and hire Nishan.\n\nSolution Fit\n\nThe proposed solution involves creating a 1-4 page marketing piece that:\n\n  - Explains FTE and Blended FTE options clearly\n  - Highlights flexibility and customization options\n  - Uses simple language (7th-grade level) and visual elements\n  - Focuses on client needs and pain points rather than technical details\n\nTech Stack\n\n  - WhatsApp for communication\n  - Potentially Slack for project collaboration\n  - Design software (e.g. Adobe suite) for final production\n\nObjections\n\n  - Concern about overpromising or creating false urgency\n  - Worry about including too much information in a short piece\n  - Potential difficulty in simplifying complex concepts\n\nCompetitors\n\nNo specific competitors mentioned in the transcript.\n\nTimeline\n\nNo specific timeline mentioned, but Brian emphasizes the need for multiple revision rounds and thorough development of the content.\n\nNext Steps\n\n1.  Nishan to provide a quote for the project\n2.  Nishan to connect with Ashant via WhatsApp to schedule a meeting\n3.  Nishan to begin working on initial content draft\n4.  Brian to set up interviews with conference contacts for additional input\n\nQ&A\n\nOur Questions\n\nWhat specific metrics or stories can we include?\n\nBrian suggested creating user journey examples, such as:\n\n  - Filling a gap after an employee quits\n  - Building a dedicated team for web application development\n  - Scaling up an existing team quickly\n  - Providing a flexible bench for agencies with directors but no execution staff\n  - Adding technical expertise to a non-technical organization\n\nAny industries or cases we should highlight?\n\nBrian did not specify particular industries, focusing instead on use cases and client needs.\n\nAny constraints that we must not promise?\n\n  - Immediate availability for U.S. Eastern hours (takes time to arrange)\n  - 24/7 availability of staff\n  - Ability to work beyond standard hours without prior arrangement\n  - Ignoring differences in holidays between U.S. and India\n\nTheir Questions\n\nHow do we mitigate potential issues with dedicated staff?\n\nBrian explained that White Label IQ has processes in place, including:\n\n  - Regular check-ins and reviews\n  - HR support and professional development\n  - Open communication channels with clients\n  - Ability to transition staff if issues arise\n\nCan I meet with Ashant to discuss the project?\n\nBrian arranged for Nishan to connect with Ashant via WhatsApp to schedule a meeting at their convenience.\n", "title": "Nishan Raj _ Kick Off Call _ White Label IQ"}}
